# Ionic Braintree Checkout Sample implementation

This is a sample 4 step form implementation featuring three braintree procedures:
- create customer
- save (and validate) credit card
- charge the card

You need your own server-side implamentation. Example Silex (PHP) implementation for this demo can be found at http://https://github.com/MichaelKubovic/braintree-silex-demo.

Don't forget to set your server url in braintreeService.js.
